including 8 lags of (1-L)d_l_GDP
sample size 106
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.390268
  test statistic: tau_c(1) = -2.55976
  asymptotic p-value 0.1015
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: -0.003
  lagged differences: F(8, 96) = 1.039 [0.4125]
