Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for d_d_l_GDP
including 8 lags of (1-L)d_d_l_GDP
sample size 105
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -3.33209
  test statistic: tau_c(1) = -5.24225
  asymptotic p-value 6.352e-06
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: 0.012
  lagged differences: F(8, 95) = 1.925 [0.0649]
