Step 1: testing for a unit root in Short

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for Short
testing down from 8 lags, criterion AIC
sample size 74
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  including 0 lags of (1-L)Short
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.098126
  test statistic: tau_c(1) = -1.96889
  asymptotic p-value 0.3009
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: 0.103

Step 2: testing for a unit root in Long

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for Long
testing down from 8 lags, criterion AIC
sample size 70
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  including 4 lags of (1-L)Long
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.00436472
  test statistic: tau_c(1) = -0.172702
  asymptotic p-value 0.9395
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: 0.018
  lagged differences: F(4, 64) = 2.151 [0.0847]

Step 3: cointegrating regression

Cointegrating regression - 
OLS, using observations 1952:2-1970:4 (T = 75)
Dependent variable: Short

             coefficient   std. error   t-ratio   p-value 
  --------------------------------------------------------

Mean dependent var   4.738000   S.D. dependent var   1.670707

Step 4: testing for a unit root in uhat

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for uhat
testing down from 8 lags, criterion AIC
sample size 73
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test without constant 
  including one lag of (1-L)uhat
  model: (1-L)y = (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.451844
  test statistic: tau_c(2) = -4.23992
  asymptotic p-value 0.00312
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: 0.006

There is evidence for a cointegrating relationship if:
(a) The unit-root hypothesis is not rejected for the individual variables, and
(b) the unit-root hypothesis is rejected for the residuals (uhat) from the 
    cointegrating regression.
