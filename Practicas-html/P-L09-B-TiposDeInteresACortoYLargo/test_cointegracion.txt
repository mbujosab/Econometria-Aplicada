Step 1: testing for a unit root in Short

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for Short
including 4 lags of (1-L)Short
sample size 70
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.0815354
  test statistic: tau_c(1) = -1.37939
  asymptotic p-value 0.5941
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: -0.004
  lagged differences: F(4, 64) = 1.429 [0.2344]

Step 2: testing for a unit root in Long

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for Long
including 4 lags of (1-L)Long
sample size 70
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.00436472
  test statistic: tau_c(1) = -0.172702
  asymptotic p-value 0.9395
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: 0.018
  lagged differences: F(4, 64) = 2.151 [0.0847]

Step 3: cointegrating regression

Cointegrating regression - 
OLS, using observations 1952:2-1970:4 (T = 75)
Dependent variable: Short

             coefficient   std. error   t-ratio   p-value 
  --------------------------------------------------------
  const       -1.16917     0.350071     -3.340    0.0013   ***
  Long         0.998553    0.0573798    17.40     1.09e-27 ***

Mean dependent var   4.738000   S.D. dependent var   1.670707
Sum squared resid    40.11837   S.E. of regression   0.741328
R-squared            0.805772   Adjusted R-squared   0.803112
Log-likelihood      -82.95837   Akaike criterion     169.9167

rho                  0.623582   Durbin-Watson        0.751581

Step 4: testing for a unit root in uhat

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for uhat
including 4 lags of (1-L)uhat
sample size 70
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test without constant 
  model: (1-L)y = (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.354525
  test statistic: tau_c(2) = -2.30363
  asymptotic p-value 0.3711
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: -0.003
  lagged differences: F(4, 65) = 0.886 [0.4776]

There is evidence for a cointegrating relationship if:
(a) The unit-root hypothesis is not rejected for the individual variables, and
(b) the unit-root hypothesis is rejected for the residuals (uhat) from the 
    cointegrating regression.
