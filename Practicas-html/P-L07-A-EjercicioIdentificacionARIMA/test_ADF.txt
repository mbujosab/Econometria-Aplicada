Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GLS) test for l_x
testing down from 17 lags, criterion modified AIC, Perron-Qu
sample size 477
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  including 2 lags of (1-L)l_x
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.00213547
  test statistic: tau = -1.19526
  approximate p-value 0.226
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: -0.013
  lagged differences: F(2, 474) = 156.788 [0.0000]
