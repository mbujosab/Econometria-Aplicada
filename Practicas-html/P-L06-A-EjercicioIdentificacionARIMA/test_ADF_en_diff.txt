Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GLS) test for d_l_x
testing down from 17 lags, criterion modified AIC, Perron-Qu
sample size 468
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  including 10 lags of (1-L)d_l_x
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.145647
  test statistic: tau = -3.18886
  approximate p-value 0.001
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: 0.001
  lagged differences: F(10, 457) = 35.578 [0.0000]
