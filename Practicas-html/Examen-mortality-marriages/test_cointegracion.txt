Step 1: testing for a unit root in Std_mortality

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for Std_mortality
testing down from 9 lags, criterion AIC
sample size 45
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  including 0 lags of (1-L)Std_mortality
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): 0.00678121
  test statistic: tau_c(1) = 0.615887
  asymptotic p-value 0.9902
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: 0.085

Step 2: testing for a unit root in Proportion_marriages

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for Proportion_marriages
testing down from 9 lags, criterion AIC
sample size 39
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test with constant 
  including 6 lags of (1-L)Proportion_marriages
  model: (1-L)y = b0 + (a-1)*y(-1) + ... + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): 0.0831149
  test statistic: tau_c(1) = 1.04236
  asymptotic p-value 0.9971
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: -0.068
  lagged differences: F(6, 31) = 3.197 [0.0147]

Step 3: cointegrating regression

Cointegrating regression - 
OLS, using observations 1866-1911 (T = 46)
Dependent variable: Std_mortality

                      coefficient  std. error  t-ratio  p-value

Mean dependent var   18.32174   S.D. dependent var   2.135615

Step 4: testing for a unit root in uhat

Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for uhat
testing down from 9 lags, criterion AIC
sample size 45
unit-root null hypothesis: a = 1

  test without constant 
  including 0 lags of (1-L)uhat
  model: (1-L)y = (a-1)*y(-1) + e
  estimated value of (a - 1): -0.771717
  test statistic: tau_c(2) = -5.22784
  asymptotic p-value 5.236e-05
  1st-order autocorrelation coeff. for e: 0.023

There is evidence for a cointegrating relationship if:
(a) The unit-root hypothesis is not rejected for the individual variables, and
(b) the unit-root hypothesis is rejected for the residuals (uhat) from the 
    cointegrating regression.
